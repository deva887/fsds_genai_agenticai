print(a*b)#multiplication
print(a/b)#division with floating point or decimal point
print(a//b)#floor division will give you the int result
print(a%b)#reminder
print((50-6*4)-4*5)# follows bodmas rule
print(5**2)# means 5^2
print(3**2)# ** operator is used to calculate the powers 3^2
l=20# the equal(=) operator is used to assign  value to a variable.And it does not display any value until you ask for it
b=40
area=l*b
print(area)
